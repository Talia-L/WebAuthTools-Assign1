<h1>Making an Omelette!</h1>
<h2>by Talia LeRay</h2>

<p>I make this omelette when I am at my home in Brooklyn, typically on a Saturday morning.</p>

<h3>Here are the ingredients I use to make an omelette:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li>lawry's seasoning salt</li>
    <li>garlic</li>
    <li>spinach</li>
    <li>tomato</li>
    <li>bacon or sausage</li>
    <li>pepppers</li>
    <li>onions</li>
    <li>4 cheese mix</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to make an omelette (my way):</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Crack both eggs in a bowl and mix it until scrambled.</li>

    <li>Make a choice of the meat you want (sausage, bacon or both!) and allow the meat(s) to cook in a pan.</li>

    <li>Chop up the garlic, spinach, tomato, onion, peppers and the peppers while the meat is cooking. Check on the meat as you're chopping up the ingredients.</li>

    <li>Add the chopped ingredients and the cooked meat to the bowl with the scrambled eggs. Base the bottom of a pan and add the mix to the pan</li>

    <li>Allow the omelette to cook on one side for 4 minutes on a medium to low fire and turn over when done. Add cheese (if you want) to the omlette and close it</li>

    <li>ENJOY!</li>
